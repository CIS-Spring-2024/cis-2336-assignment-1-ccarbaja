            Carlos took over ownership of Sugar Land's Honestly <em>Amazing</em> Cafeteria after a series of riots took place back in 2015. The riots originall
            started out as a food fight, which eventually turned into fights over food. The original owner decided to punish the members of the Cafeteria
            by limiting pizza from a weekly basis to a bimonthly basis. This resulted in a mass loss of membership, and the share holders switfly took
            action by replacing him with Mr. Carlos. Since then, UH Sugar Land's Honestly Amazing has received nothing short of stellar reviews after a massive overhaul of the menu
            and aesthetic change the cafeteria has underwent.
